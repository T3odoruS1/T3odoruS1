    I'm a first year student
    in <a href="https://taltech.ee/" >TalTech</a>.
I study IT system development. Started to study programming about one year before university and started with python.
    During the last academical year I've passed two python courses form our university. After passing them I realized that
I really like programming and decided to go to study what I'm studying right now. Besides, I have done some HTML in
high school, but have never hosted a website. <br>
    So this is a table where I rate my skills.
</p>
<br>

<table class="centre">
    <tr>
        <th>My skill</th>
        <th>How good I do it</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Python</td>
        <td>Wont be ahead of our program after a few weeks.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>HTML</td>
        <td>Well, if you are reading this, this page is my maximum.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>CSS</td>
        <td>This is literally the first time I'm doing this.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>JS</td>
        <td>NO</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Scratch</td>
        <td>Guru.</td>
    </tr>

</table>
